# Task

## Part 1:

Your part of the prototype will be to develop a Web API that will be used by customers to manage a basket of items.

This API will allow our users to set up and manage an order of items. The API will allow users to add and remove items and change the quantity of the items they want. They should also be able to simply clear out all items from their order and start again.

The functionality to complete the purchase of the items will be handled separately and will be written by a different team once this prototype is complete.  

Web api with the following 
- Create basket
- add items
- remove items
- change quantity of items
- clear basket
